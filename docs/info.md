## How it works

Decimation filter used to reduce the sample frequency of an incremental and a regular Delta-Sigma Modulator by a factor of 16.

Input: 1 bit
Output: 16 bits

Connect an ADC with a 1 bit output 
After oversampling, the output of a Delta-Sigma modulator is at a much higher data rate than necessary. The decimation filter not only removes unwanted high-frequency noise but also reduces the data rate, making the ADCâ€™s output usable for further processing.

Decimaiton filter removes high-frequency quantization noise introduced during oversampling. As well as reduces the sampling rate by downsampling the data, making it easier to handle and process while maintaining signal integrity.

Without the decimation filter, the oversampled output of the Delta-Sigma ADC would have too much noise and an unnecessarily high data rate, making it inefficient and difficult to process further.
